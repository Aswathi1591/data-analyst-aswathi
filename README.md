**DESCRIPTIVE ANALYSIS**

**Project title:** Cloud-Based Descriptive Analysis of Public Washroom Infrastructure Using AWS Services

**Project description / Objective:** 
This project presents a comprehensive descriptive analysis of a public washroom dataset by leveraging scalable, secure, and cost-effective AWS services. The primary objective is to analyze certain features of public infrastructure using AWS Clous tools while demonstrating a structured data pipeline.

Using services such as Amazon S3, AWS Glue, DataBrew, and Athena, the project implements a complete ETL workflowâ€”from data ingestion and transformation to storage and analysis. The dataset, once cleaned and processed, was queried using SQL via AWS Athena and visualized for insights regarding usage patterns, location distribution, and data quality.

Advanced cloud functionalities such as KMS-based encryption, lifecycle policies, versioning, and CloudWatch monitoring were configured to ensure data integrity, cost optimization, and auditability. The project highlights the practical integration of descriptive analytics with cloud data engineering to support infrastructure planning and operational decision-making.

**Dataset:**
The dataset used in this project is titled "Public Washrooms" and contains metadata on public restroom facilities, likely sourced from City of Vancouver open data portal. It includes structured information about washroom locations, accessibility, operational details, and facility types.
